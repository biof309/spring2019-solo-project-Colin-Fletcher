Searching for Phenotypic Information with a Gene Name



Description
===========

The International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium makes knockout mice, phenotypes them, and disseminates the data from www.impc.org. Searching the website to find data for a specific gene is somewhat cumbersome and a script to quickly return phenotype data for a gene would be useful.
